- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @EdalScript
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in anything that has to do with JavaScript and its libraries. Also I do enjoy the experience of being a QA tester.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently React hooks and components, but whenever I get some time I like to read React-Native docs just to have an excuse of not limiting myself to just one area. I guess I like to learn new stuff!
- ðŸ“« I'm always around, should you feel like contacting me to make questions or for anything, hit me up at edalscript@gmail.com
